HOW TO DEPLOY TO SERVER

1. TO to ./scripts then run: sudo bash deploy_step_one.sh
2. Running the above script will restart your server after it's finished
3. SSH into your server again and now run from ./scripts: sudo bash deploy_step_two.sh
4. Running this should have install all your python dependencies, but this doesn't happen within your virtualenv, thus, run:
  workon buzzz
  pip install -r /home/arbiter/buzzz/requirements.txt
5. This will finalize your deployment process
