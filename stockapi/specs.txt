The Stockapi model is used on all servers in Buzzz.

Since all states are controlled through the DB,
and other servers need to have access to these states,
Stockapi app also contains a table named: StockapiState

A trigger exists to open a channel through PostgreSQL on this table,
and notifies other apps of any changes to this table.


NOTE THAT:
API's on Stockapi does not let users or even superusers create data
The creation of data can occur through the gateway server
All Stockapi API's should only be that of Listing (GET)
